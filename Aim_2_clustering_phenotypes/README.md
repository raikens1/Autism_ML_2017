# Cluster Validation Tool Kit

The purpose of this project is to create a reusable tool kit for analyzing clustering results within the Wall Lab at Stanford University. It was applied to the kmeans and soft kmeans clustering results generated by Kelley Paskov on 10-24-17 and 12-1-17.

## File Structure

- *kmeans_crisp_analysis.ipynb*: feature heatmap, centroid heatmap, label pie charts, label enrichment tests, and individual movement analysis for kmeans clustering results with k=2,3,...,6 generated on 10-24-17 and 12-1-17
- *kmeans_soft_to_single_analysis.ipynb*: feature heatmap, centroid heatmap, label pie charts, label enrichment tests, and individual movement analysis for soft kmeans clustering results with k=2,3,...,6 generated on 10-24-17 and 12-1-17 where individuals were assigned to a cluster based on the cluster they had maximum membership in
- *kmeans_soft_to_multiple_analysis.ipynb*: feature heatmap, centroid heatmap, label pie charts, and label enrichment tests for soft kmeans clustering results with k=2,3,...,6 generated on 10-24-17 and 12-1-17 where individuals were assigned to any cluster they had partial membership in
- *kmeans_soft_analysis.ipynb*: feature heatmap and centroid heatmap for soft kmeans clustering results with k=2,3,...,6 generated on 10-24-17 and 12-1-17
